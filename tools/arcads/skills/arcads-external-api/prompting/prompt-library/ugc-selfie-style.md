# UGC selfie-style video — cross-model prompting guide

**Applies to:** Veo 3.1, Sora 2, Kling 3.0 (via Arcads scene / b-roll / direct model routes)  
**Aesthetic:** iPhone-shot, Instagram Reels, unpolished realism

Use this guide when the user wants **authentic-looking UGC** — selfie angles, handheld shake, imperfect lighting, casual speech. The biggest mistake is letting the AI produce polished cinematic output; UGC works because it feels real.

## Core principles (all models)

### 1. Camera physics — simulate a smartphone

Stop using "cinematic," "8k," or "award-winning." Instead:

- **Lens:** "iPhone 15 Pro front camera in selfie mode," "native wide lens (~26 mm)," "f/2.2 aperture"
- **Focus:** "Autofocus micro-pulses," "deep focus (everything sharp)," "no artificial blur"
- **Lighting:** "Unbalanced exposure," "slight overexposure in bright areas," "auto white balance with a slight blue cast"
- **Imperfections:** "Subtle edge distortion," "natural micro lens flare," "rolling-shutter micro-artifacts," "mild luminance grain"

### 2. "Accidental" composition

- "Awkward angle," "messy crop," "deliberately mediocre framing"
- "Unpolished casual home environment," "cluttered background"
- Avoid "centered framing" or "perfect composition"

### 3. Natural human motion (CRITICAL — what separates AI from real)

AI video defaults to a frozen mannequin staring at camera. Real people are constantly moving, distracted, and imperfect. **Always include at least 3-4 of these cues** in every UGC video prompt:

#### Eye behavior
- "Briefly breaks eye contact with the camera, glances down or to the side, then looks back"
- "Eyes dart to something off-screen for a moment before refocusing on the lens"
- "Looks at the product in their hand, then back to camera"
- "Blinks naturally, not a fixed stare"

#### Head and face
- "Slight head tilts while talking, not perfectly still"
- "Nods along with their own words"
- "Raises eyebrows for emphasis mid-sentence"
- "Purses lips or pauses to think before continuing"
- "Caught mid-thought, slight hesitation"

#### Body movement
- "Shifts weight from one foot to the other"
- "Leans toward camera for emphasis, then leans back"
- "Adjusts their grip on the product"
- "Fidgets with their hair or touches their face briefly"
- "Turns the product to show a different angle"
- "Takes a small step back or repositions"

#### Full scene motion (when appropriate)
- "Walks from one part of the room to another while talking"
- "Sits down on the couch/bed mid-sentence"
- "Paces slowly while explaining"
- "Turns around to show the background, then turns back to camera"

#### Selfie arm
- "Holding the camera at arm's length, arm extended naturally, clearly visible in the frame"
- "Adjusts phone angle mid-video"
- "Quick handheld adjustments, slightly shaky one-hand grip"

### 4. Negative prompting

Always exclude: "studio lighting, professional photography, stock photo, perfect skin, heavy makeup, centered framing, staged, cinematic, LUT, color graded, stabilization, no subtitles, no captions, no text overlays, no on-screen text"

## Model-specific strategies

### Veo 3.1 — scene and shot designer

**Formula:** `[Camera] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Context/Lighting] + [Style/Imperfections] + [Dialogue/Audio]`

- Start with **"A selfie video of..."** to trigger correct framing
- Lock perspective with `(thats where the camera is)` syntax
- Add **"The image is slightly grainy, looks very film-like"** to fight Veo's clean default
- **ALWAYS end with:** `"No subtitles, no captions, no text overlays."` — Veo 3.1 will sometimes burn subtitles into the video if you don't explicitly exclude them
- For multi-shot Reels, use timestamps: `[00:00-00:02] ... [00:02-00:04] ...`
- Sweet spot: **75–125 words**

**Example:**
```text
A selfie video of a 25-year-old woman in her messy apartment holding
the camera at arm's length (thats where the camera is). Her right arm
is clearly visible in the frame. Natural lighting from a large window
creates unbalanced, soft shadows. She is casually talking — she briefly
breaks eye contact to glance down at the product in her hand, then
looks back at camera. She tilts her head slightly, nods along with her
own words, raises her eyebrows for emphasis. She shifts her weight and
leans toward the camera, then adjusts her phone angle. The image is
slightly grainy, documentary-style handheld camera work, completely
unedited vlog aesthetic. Background sounds of city traffic. She speaks
in a casual tone: 'Nobody talks about how productivity advice is just
procrastination.' No subtitles, no captions, no text overlays.
```

### Sora 2 — narrative director

**Formula:** Structure with headers: `Format & Style`, `Camera`, `Main Subject`, `Location`, `Lighting`, `Actions & Camera Beats`

- Break into **second-by-second beats** (`0-4s: [Action]`, `4-8s: [Action]`)
- Specify raw audio: "Raw phone audio: slight room echo, fridge hum, auto gain fluctuates with voice volume"
- Use "autofocus micro-pulses," "completely ungraded iPhone video," "flat colors"

**Example:**
```text
Format & Style: UGC reaction video – authentic, handheld, shot on
front iPhone camera. Style: unfiltered realism, slight overexposure.
Camera: iPhone 15 Pro front camera in selfie mode. Handheld one-hand
shot, slightly shaky with autofocus micro-pulses. No stabilization.
Main Subject: Late 20s male, oversized hoodie, messy hair.
Location: Plain kitchen, daylight spilling through blinds.
Lighting: Pure natural light from side window — unbalanced exposure.
Actions & Camera Beats (0-8s):
  0-4s — Subject lifts coffee cup close to camera, eyes wide.
         Focus flickers between face and cup.
  4-8s — Laughs, shakes head gently. Quick handheld adjustments.
Dialogue: "Guys, I swear this is the best thing I've ever tasted."
Sound: Raw phone audio, slight room echo, background hiss intact.
```

### Kling 3.0 — motion operator

**Formula:** Think physics engine: `[Environment] -> [Lighting] -> [Camera Movement] -> [Subject/Product Behavior]`

- **Describe physics:** Not "she turns her head" but "She turns her head slowly left to right. Her hair follows just behind, catches the light. Slight tension in her neck."
- **Anchor hands** to objects to avoid AI hand morphing: "holding a phone," "gripping a coffee cup"
- **Emphasize texture:** "Visible breath," "sweat," "fabric sheen," "condensation," "visible skin pores"
- Keep prompts **compact and operational** — trim poetic language

**Example:**
```text
Medium close-up mirror selfie. A Korean-American woman in a white
dressing room holding a phone. Handheld smartphone drift, subtle sway.
Natural overhead fluorescent lighting casting slight shadows. She looks
into the mirror, waves her hand casually. Motion details: natural
wrist rotation, fabric of her sleeve moves with the gesture. Texture:
visible skin pores, slight grain of phone camera. She speaks softly:
'Just testing this out. The details are crazy.' Tone is breathy and
impressed. Realistic facial motion, subtle eye blinks.
```

## Instagram Reels checklist (final pass)

- [ ] **Aspect ratio:** 9:16 specified
- [ ] **Hook:** First 2 seconds have dynamic motion or strong facial expression
- [ ] **Lighting:** "Natural," "window light," or "room lighting" — NOT "studio" or "cinematic"
- [ ] **Camera:** "iPhone front camera," "selfie-style," "handheld shake" stated
- [ ] **Flaws:** At least two imperfections included (grain, overexposure, focus hunting, messy background)
