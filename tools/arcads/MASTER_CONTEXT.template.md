# Master context (project + agents)

**Purpose:** One place for humans and AI agents to capture **decisions**, **brand voice**, **API quirks**, and **what we learned** while using this repo.

## How agents should use this file

- **At the start of substantive work:** Read this file for project-specific context that is not in the skill.
- **After meaningful changes:** Append a new **dated entry** under [Changelog](#changelog) (Decision / What changed / Why).
- **If fields are empty:** Offer to populate them — ask the user once and write the values back.

## Brand (optional)

_Edit or replace with your real brand blocks. A starter template lives at `skills/<this-repo's-api>-external-api/prompting/brand-voice-starter.md` (e.g. `skills/arcads-external-api/...` in the Arcads repo, `skills/kie-external-api/...` in the KIE repo)._

- **Tone:**
- **Audience:**
- **Words to use / avoid:**

## Reference images

Drop reference images into the `references/` folder at the repo root:
- `references/influencers/` — face/body photos to recreate as AI people
- `references/products/` — product photos for showcase workflows
- `references/aesthetics/` — mood boards, lighting references, style inspiration

The agent checks this folder when composing prompts. (If the API in this repo requires hosted URLs rather than local file uploads, also fill in your hosting strategy in the API-specific section below.)

## Universal prompting principles

These apply across all generative-image and generative-video APIs.

### UGC realism

- **Imperfection block (camera):** Every UGC image/video prompt must include camera imperfections: motion blur, overexposure, grain, lens distortion, off-center framing, soft focus. Without this, output looks too polished.
- **Skin realism block (mandatory):** Include 3–4 subtle skin cues inline with character description: "visible pores, slight unevenness in skin tone, minor undereye shadows, hint of shine from natural oils." Do NOT use: acne, pimples, breakouts, blemishes, redness. Goal is "real person, not retouched" — not "person with skin problems."
- **Reference image order:** character hero first (strongest identity signal), then product, then style refs.

### Influencer / character recreation

- Two-step flow: (1) generate a still image with the reference image as input, (2) show user for approval, (3) only then generate video using the approved still as the start frame / reference.
- Never skip the approval step — video is expensive, stills are cheap to iterate.

### Image QA

- Visually review still images after generation (hands, fingers, limbs, face, merged objects, artifacts).
- If defective, regenerate with refined prompt — up to **2 retries** (3 attempts total).
- QA retries skip a second credit confirmation but still bill credits.

### Video prompting

- **No subtitles, no captions, no text overlays** — append this clause to every prompt; many video models burn captions in by default.
- **Human motion cues are mandatory** for person-on-screen videos: 3–4 cues per prompt (breaking eye contact, head tilts, weight shifts, grip adjustments). Without these, subjects look like frozen mannequins.

## Meta ad deployment

Used by the **`meta-ad-builder`** shared skill (`shared/skills/meta-ad-builder/`) — publishes
finished creatives as Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ads. Fill in your account IDs once; the skill
reads them so you don't paste them every run. These are account identifiers, not secrets, but
the file is gitignored either way.

- **Default ad account** (`META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID`):
- **Facebook Page ID** (`META_PAGE_ID`):
- **Instagram user ID** (`META_IG_USER_ID`):
- **Meta Pixel ID** (`META_PIXEL_ID`):
- **Default destination URL / offer link:**
- **Default ad set(s) to deploy into** (name → ID):
- **Default CTA type** (e.g. `SIGN_UP`, `LEARN_MORE`):

The access token itself (`META_ACCESS_TOKEN`) lives in `.env`, never here. Every ad the skill
creates is **PAUSED** — review and un-pause in Meta Ads Manager.



## Project snapshot — Arcads

- **API base:** `https://external-api.arcads.ai` (see `.env.example`).
- **Auth:** HTTP Basic via `ARCADS_BASIC_AUTH` (pre-encoded `Basic ...` header) or `ARCADS_API_KEY` as Basic password. Values in `.env` must be **single-quoted** (special chars: `{`, `[`, `*`).
- **Skill:** `.claude/skills/arcads-external-api/` and `.cursor/skills/arcads-external-api/` (sync from `skills/arcads-external-api/` via `scripts/sync-skill.sh`).

## My workspace

- **Default product ID:** _(auto-populated after first `GET /v1/products` call)_
- **Default product name:** _(auto-populated)_

## Credit costs

_Fill in your plan's credit costs below. The agent references this table before every generation. If left blank, the agent will ask you once and can fill them in._

| Model | Credits per generation | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Veo 3.1 | 1 | Same cost at 720p, 1080p, and 4K |
| Sora 2 | _(fill in)_ | |
| Sora 2 Pro | _(fill in)_ | Auto-selected when using `refImageAsBase64` |
| Kling 3.0 (scene) | _(fill in)_ | |
| Kling 3.0 (b-roll) | _(fill in)_ | |
| Nano Banana 2 (image, `nano-banana-2`) | 0.03 | ~35s generation time |
| Nano Banana Pro (image, `nano-banana`) | _(fill in)_ | |
| Nano Banana (scene) | _(fill in)_ | |

## API learnings — Arcads

These are confirmed behaviors of the Arcads external API.

### Auth

- HTTP Basic with `ARCADS_BASIC_AUTH` (pre-encoded header from dashboard) or `ARCADS_API_KEY` as Basic username.
- Values in `.env` must be **single-quoted** due to special characters (`{`, `[`, `*`).

### Nano Banana image endpoint

- `POST /V2/images/generate` (note **uppercase V2**). `model` is **required**.
- Valid models: `nano-banana`, `nano-banana-2`, `gpt-image`, `soul`, `grok_image`, `seedream`, `seedream_5_lite`.
- Default to `nano-banana-2` (Nano Banana 2). `nano-banana` = Nano Banana Pro (no `nano-banana-pro` in the API enum).
- Output: `.png` at the `url` field on the asset response (no `thumbnailUrl`).
- Generation time: ~35 seconds typical.
- Auth: must use `Authorization: Basic ...` header.

### Scene for image-like output

- `POST /v1/scene` with only `productId`, `prompt`, `aspectRatio` produces a short video + `.jpg` thumbnail.
- Best path when you need a still frame to feed into another model (before the Nano Banana image endpoint was confirmed).
- No `duration` required (unlike b-roll which needs 5 or 10).

### B-roll

- Requires `duration` (5 or 10 seconds).
- Slower to generate than scene (~5 min vs ~75s).

### Veo 3.1

- `startFrame` vs `referenceImages` are **mutually exclusive**. `startFrame` = video animates from this exact image. `referenceImages` = style/mood inspiration only.
- Default: always use `startFrame` when user provides a single person photo.
- No `duration` field — auto-determines length (~8s typical).
- **Default resolution: `720p`** — 4K and 1080p show no visible quality difference for UGC content but produce 3-8x larger files.

### Sora 2

- `refImageAsBase64` is a **style/mood reference only** — it does NOT preserve face, pose, or scene from the input image. Do NOT use Sora 2 to animate a specific starting frame.
- Best for: text-only video generation, or when you just have a product photo and want to generate a UGC video directly (no starting frame step).
- Supports duration up to 20s (enum: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20).

### File upload (for Veo start frames / reference images)

- `POST /v1/file-upload/get-presigned-url` — field is `fileType`, **not** `contentType`.
- Response: `presignedUrl` (for `PUT` upload) + `filePath` (pass into `startFrame` / `referenceImages`).

### Kling / Nano Banana video routing

- No dedicated POST endpoints for Kling. Asset type enums (`kling_30`, `nano-banana`) exist on responses.
- Model selection may be server-side for b-roll/scene.

### Polling

- `GET /v1/assets/{id}` — status goes `pending` -> `generated` | `failed`.
- Typical times: scene ~75s, b-roll ~5 min, Veo 3.1 ~4 min, Nano Banana image ~35s.

### Product API

- `ProductCreationDto` has text-only fields (`name`, `description`, `targetAudience`, `mainFeatures`, `painPoint`, `perceived`) — no image upload.
- Product images are dashboard-only (`pictureId` field).
- The Arcads script/actor pipeline (situations, voices) is a separate system from the Veo/Sora/Kling direct-model routes.

### Folder / project organization

- Every agent session that generates assets should create (or reuse) a folder named **"Arcads API - YYYY-MM-DD"** with a matching project inside it, then assign all generated assets to that project.
- API calls: `POST /v1/folders`, `POST /v1/projects`, `POST /v1/assets/add-to-project`. Check `GET /v1/products/{productId}/folders` first to avoid duplicates.
